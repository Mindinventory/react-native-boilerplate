The Boilerplate contains all the basic packages, common components and, prebuilt code architecture. It will save developer's project setup time.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a boilerplate for React Native projects, providing a solid foundation to kickstart your development process. It includes a collection of scripts to generate images and icons, making it easier to customize your app's visual assets.

Create a new project using the boilerplate :

**For React Native Cli**

```
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init APP_NAME --template @mindinventory/react-native-boilerplate
```

**For Expo**

```
npx @mindinventory/react-native-boilerplate
```
