# Customization

Feel free to customize the React Native Boilerplate to fit your project's specific needs

The React Native boilerplate provides a flexible foundation, but true power lies in tailoring it to your project's specific needs. Let's delve deeper into some key customization areas:

### App Configuration:

    - #### `app.json`:
    This file serves as the central configuration point for your React Native app. You can modify settings like the app name, icons, splash screen, and more. Refer to the official React Native documentation for a complete list of configurable options: https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/issues/1113

    - #### `babel.config.js`:
    This file defines how Babel transpiles your modern JavaScript code into a format compatible with older browsers or environments. You might need to adjust presets or plugins based on the libraries or frameworks you integrate. Check out the Babel documentation for in-depth configuration details: https://babeljs.io/docs/configuration

    - #### `metro.config.js`:
    This configuration file controls Metro, the bundler used in React Native development. You can customize aspects like asset resolution, source maps, and watch mode behavior. Explore the official Metro documentation for a comprehensive overview of configuration options: https://reactnative.dev/docs/metro

### Directory Structure:

    The boilerplate offers a well-organized directory structure, but you can adapt it for better project clarity, especially for larger codebases.

### Styling and Theming:

    Modify the existing styles and themes or add your own to create a unique visual identity for your app.

### Additional Scripts:

    Extend the scripts directory with your own scripts to automate repetitive tasks specific to your project.
