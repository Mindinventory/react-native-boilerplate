```

- **Text**: Text element(typography) for app consist presets of all font family and font-size that we have to use in app.
  For Example:

  ```js
  import { Text } from "@app/blueprints"
  ;<Text preset="h1">{contents("newsList", "breakingNews")}</Text>
  ```

- **Image**: React Native's Image component handles image caching like browsers for the most part using `react-native-fast-image` library.
  For Example:

  ```js
  import { Image } from "@app/blueprints"
  ;<Image source={sourcePath} {...props} />
  ```

- **Indicator**: Show loader in app with customize way. use it form context of app.
  For Example:

  ```js
  const { loader } = useAppContext()

  //to show Indicator
  loader.current.show()
  //to hide Indicator
  loader.current.hide()
  //get Indicator status
  loader.current.isLoading
  ```

- **Button**: Animated scalability adds an extra layer of interactivity to your buttons with TouchableOpacity
  For Example:

  ```js
  import { Button } from "@app/blueprints"
  ;<Button
    buttonContainerStyle={{ marginTop: scaleHeight(15) }}
    title="Go back"
    {...TouchableOpacityProps}
  />
  ```

- **TextInput**: Material UI all input variant added.
  For Example:

  ```tsx
  import { Input } from "@app/blueprints"
  ;<Input variant="standard" {...TextInputProps} />
